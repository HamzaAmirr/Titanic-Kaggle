## Introduction

In this notebook, we explore the Titanic dataset, preprocess the data, and build several machine learning models to predict the survival of passengers. The models are evaluated, and the best performing model is used to make predictions on the test data.

## Titanic Dataset Summary

The Titanic dataset contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic. It includes features such as:
- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for each passenger.
- **Survived**: Survival status (0 = No, 1 = Yes).
- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1 = 1st, 2 = 2nd, 3 = 3rd).
- **Name**: Name of the passenger.
- **Sex**: Gender of the passenger.
- **Age**: Age of the passenger.
- **SibSp**: Number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic.
- **Parch**: Number of parents or children aboard the Titanic.
- **Ticket**: Ticket number.
- **Fare**: Ticket fare.
- **Cabin**: Cabin number.
- **Embarked**: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).

The goal is to use this information to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster.

## Importing Libraries

This section involves importing the necessary libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Scikit-learn for machine learning, and other utilities.

## Loading the Dataset

The Titanic dataset from Kaggle is loaded into a Pandas DataFrame. This dataset includes information about the passengers aboard the Titanic, such as age, gender, class, and whether they survived the disaster.

## Data Exploration

Initial exploration of the dataset is performed to understand its structure and contents. This includes viewing the first few rows of the DataFrame and summarizing the data.

## Data Preprocessing

### Handling Missing Values

Missing values in the dataset are handled by either dropping columns with too many missing values or filling missing values with appropriate statistics such as the mean.

### Feature Encoding

Categorical features are converted into numerical values using techniques like label encoding, which is necessary for machine learning algorithms to process the data effectively.

## Model Building

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is built and trained on the training data. The performance of this model is evaluated, but it does not perform well in this case.

### Gaussian Naive Bayes

A Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is built and trained. This model performs better than the SVM model.

### XGBoost

An XGBoost classifier is built and trained. This model shows the best performance among the models tried.

## Model Evaluation

The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and other metrics. The XGBoost model is identified as the best performing model.

## Prediction on Test Data

The best performing model (XGBoost) is used to make predictions on the test dataset. The same preprocessing steps applied to the training data are applied to the test data.

## Exporting Predictions

The predictions made on the test data are exported to a CSV file. This file includes the Passenger ID and the predicted survival status.
